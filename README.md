# How to Evaluate a Research Partner Vendor

_Last updated: May 9, 2025_

Each project will have different needs, so evaluation criteria will differ. This list offers a jumping off point. You may only need a vendor to help recruit participants. You may need a vendor to recruit participants, conduct research, and pay participants.

Below are considerations that have been put together by the Colorado Digital Service design team. These considerations can be used in a modular fashion based on a project’s needs.
